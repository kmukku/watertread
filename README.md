# WaterTread Generator

**WaterTread** is an innovative, nature-friendly renewable energy solution designed to harness power from slow-moving waters. The unique **continuous tread design** with adjustable blades offers high efficiency while maintaining minimal environmental impact.

## Features

- **Innovative Tread Design**  
  Captures energy in two dimensions, maximizing energy capture with a longer surface area and reducing back drag using adjustable blades.

- **Scalable**  
  WaterTread units are modular and can be deployed in arrays to meet various energy demands.

- **Nature-Friendly**  
  Fully submerged, with minimal disruption to natural water ecosystems and no barriers to fish migration.

- **Customizable Configurations**  
  Can be adapted to rivers of varying flow rates and depths, with optional funnels to increase efficiency.

## Specifications

| Feature            | Details                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Dimensions**     | Fits in a standard 20-ft container |
| **Output**         | TBD, but designed to exceed traditional rotor-based models (1–10 kW @ ~6.4 km/h flow rate) |
| **Environmental Impact** | Minimal disruption, fully submerged |

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Tread Mechanism**  
   Compared to current rotary models, the tread mechanism captures energy in two dimensions. While rotary models operate within a single circular plane, the tread design extends along the river's flow, creating a longer, moving "circle" that maximizes contact with the water and enhances energy capture.

2. **Adjustable Blades**  
   The blades automatically adjust their angle during each cycle. On the topside, they are angled to maximize water flow and energy capture, while on the underside, they shift to minimize drag and resistance.

3. **Modular Deployment**  
   Multiple units can be arranged in arrays to scale energy production efficiently.

4. **Optional Funnels**  
   Side-mounted funnels can be used to concentrate flow and increase efficiency, especially in shallow or slow-moving rivers.

## Applications

- Powering communities, industries, and eco-conscious households
- Supplementing municipal energy grids with renewable power
- Providing sustainable energy for remote or off-grid locations
